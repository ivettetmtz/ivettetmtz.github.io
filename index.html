    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

      Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program has allowed me to not only solidify my technical knowledge but also showcase my strengths to prepare me for the field of computer science with confidence. My experience with collaborating in a team environment has emphasized collaboration for peer code reviews and managing conflicts, such as setting up systems and software in many courses. Communicating with stakeholders is vital when communicating in any tech role. Whether it is writing documentation, presenting projects, or solving complex coding problems, I learned to present solutions and provide updates for my work as you would in a real-world setting. Understanding data structures and algorithms is a great foundation for computer science, and this program has trained me to handle this topic. I have implemented linked lists, binaries, and solved algorithmic problems in past courses, such as Software Development or Mobile Architecture, that prepared me to write efficient and scalable code. Software engineering and database design go hand-in-hand with data structures by teaching me to maintain applications using design principles, development life cycles, and unit testing. These skills helped me focus on building full-stack applications and researching front-end and back-end coding within data layers. Additionally, security is a crucial part of programming, and learning the basic practices of finding vulnerabilities,  encryption methods, and data privacy ensures I prioritize it in the early stages of the life cycle.
      The technical artifacts I have chosen for my capstone work together by showcasing the importance of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. I combined the course outcomes with problem-solving, critical thinking, and analyzing designs to enhance each artifact and tie all of the portfolios together. This allows me to demonstrate my technical achievements in each project, starting with OpenGL 3D image creation, followed by JUnit Testing and Automation, and finally API routing to a single-page application using JavaScript.
