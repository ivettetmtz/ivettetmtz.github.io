      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Completing my coursework throughout the Computer Science program has allowed me to not only solidify my technical knowledge but also showcase my strengths to prepare me for the field of computer science with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience with collaborating in a team environment emphasized peer code reviews and managing conflicts during system setup across various courses. Communicating with stakeholders is vital — whether it’s writing documentation, presenting projects, or solving complex problems, I learned to communicate progress effectively, much like in a real-world tech role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding data structures and algorithms is a strong foundation in computer science. I’ve implemented linked lists, binary trees, and solved algorithmic problems in courses like Software Development and Mobile Architecture, which trained me to write scalable, efficient code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software engineering and database design taught me to build maintainable applications using design principles, software life cycles, and unit testing. Security, an essential part of software development, helped me prioritize privacy, encryption, and vulnerability detection early in the development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        My selected technical artifacts highlight software design, engineering, algorithms, and databases — tying together problem-solving, critical thinking, and technical skills. Projects include OpenGL 3D image creation, JUnit automation, and JavaScript API routing for a single-page app.

      <h2>Artifacts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Software Design and Engineering:</strong>
          CS-330 Computer Graphics and Visualization final project (Feb 2025) — Built using Visual Studio with OpenGL to render a 3D scene with lighting, shading, and textures. Enhancements included more 3D objects, lighting sources, and clean code documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong>
          CS-320 Software Testing and QA final project (Dec 2023) — An appointment scheduler using automated testing. I improved data storage efficiency by replacing an ArrayList with a HashMap in the contact management system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Databases:</strong>
          CS-465 Full Stack Development final project (Feb 2025) — A single-page application using JavaScript to interact with a database through API routes. Enhancements included dynamic delete buttons for user trip cards tied to authenticated database entries.
